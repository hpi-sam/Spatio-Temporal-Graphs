Types of data: Time series, Anomaly covariance matrix, Adjancy Matrix, and Failure Propagation Graph.

Data Sources (Data Generation Processess):
- The Time series were generated by the SockShop installation.
- The Covariance matrix was generated by a Granger Causality model.
- The Adjancency matrix was extracted from the SockShop service graph.
- The Graph data was generated by failure propagation process.
